# German Vocabulary Space Repetition Software

This is a full-stack web application designed to help users learn German vocabulary through an intelligent, AI-powered spaced repetition system (SRS). The application uses a Flask backend to manage user progress and serve quiz questions, and a React frontend to provide an interactive user experience.

## Description

The core of this project is a smart quiz generator that selects German words for the user to practice. It prioritizes words that the user struggles with or has not seen in a while. Vocabulary data, including definitions, examples, and CEFR levels, is generated by calling the OpenAI API. User progress is tracked locally in JSON files, making the application self-contained and easy to set up.

## Features

- **Spaced Repetition System:** Words are scheduled to reappear at increasing intervals based on user performance, optimizing for long-term memory retention.
- **AI-Powered Vocabulary:** A Python script uses an AI model to generate detailed information for each vocabulary word, including meaning, word type, context, and CEFR level.
- **Multiple CEFR Levels:** Practice words from specific levels (A1, A2, B1) or a mix of all levels.
- **Performance Tracking:** The application tracks daily statistics, including the number of words practiced and overall accuracy for the day.
- **Detailed Word View:** After submitting a quiz, users can click on a word to see a detailed breakdown of all its attributes.
- **Smart Hints:** For noun quizzes, users can hover over the question to get hints about the word type or register.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Frontend:** JavaScript, React, Vite
- **Data Storage:** JSON files for vocabulary and user statistics
- **External Services:** OpenAI API for vocabulary generation

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following software installed on your computer:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js and npm (or yarn)
- Git

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mahesaJenar01/German-Space-Repetition-Software.git
    cd German-Space-Repetition-Software
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```bash
    # Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Install Python dependencies from requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Create a .env file in the root directory for your API key
    # Add the following line to the .env file:
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_secret_api_key_here"

    # (Optional) Generate initial word data from an input.txt file
    # Create an input.txt file and add German words, then run:
    python process_metrics.py
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the frontend directory
    cd frontend

    # Install Node.js dependencies
    npm install

    # Return to the root directory
    cd ..
    ```

### Running the Application

You will need to run the backend and frontend servers in two separate terminals.

1.  **Start the Backend Server (from the root directory):**
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```
    The Flask server will start running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Server (from the root directory):**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```
    The React development server will start, and you can access the application in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Usage

1.  Open the application in your web browser.
2.  Select a difficulty level (A1, A2, B1, or Mix).
3.  A quiz of five words will be generated.
4.  Fill in the answers for each word.
5.  Press the `Enter` key to submit your answers.
6.  Review your results. You can click on any word to see more details.
7.  Press `Enter` again to proceed to the next quiz.

## For Developers

This section provides more detail on the project's architecture and data flow for those looking to contribute or modify the codebase.

### Project Structure

The project is organized into a backend and a frontend, with a clear separation of concerns.

-   **/ (root)**: Contains the backend Flask application, scripts, and data folders.
-   `logic/`: The core backend business logic, separated from the web layer.
    -   `priority_metrics/`: Individual modules for calculating a word's priority score.
    -   `quiz_selector.py`: Orchestrates the selection of words for a quiz.
    -   `word_updater.py`: Handles updates to a word's repetition statistics.
    -   `report_updater.py`: Manages updates to the daily performance reports.
-   `routes/`: Flask blueprints that define the API endpoints.
-   `output/`: Contains the master JSON files (`output_a1.json`, etc.) with all vocabulary details generated by the AI.
-   `repetition-list/`: Stores user-specific progress for each word.
-   `performance-report/`: Contains the daily performance summary.
-   `frontend/`: The React application.
    -   `src/components/`: Reusable React components.
    -   `src/context/`: React Context for global state management (e.g., quiz state).
    -   `src/hooks/`: Custom hooks for managing component logic (e.g., `useQuiz`, `useDailyStats`).

### Key Scripts and Data Management

-   **`process_metrics.py`**: The script for generating new vocabulary. It reads German words from `input.txt`, calls the OpenAI API to get details, and adds the new words to the appropriate `output/{level}.json` file. It will not re-process words that already exist.
-   **`file_validator.py`**: A utility script to ensure data integrity. It scans all `output/*.json` files and corrects any words that may have been assigned the wrong CEFR level, moving them to the correct file.
